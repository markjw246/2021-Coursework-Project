        <h2>1.  A Rationale for the Approach to the Brief</h2>
        <h3>1.1  Research (approximately 150 ‐ 200 words)</h3>
        <img  id="vaccine" src="/resources/Covid-19-vaccine.jpg">
        <p>The Covid pandemic has had an enormous impact on hospitals, the economy, businesses and schools. 
            Technology is one of the main supports in finding solutions to slow down and stop the spread of 
            Covid 19. The quick transition of businesses and schools to online, remote working, prevented the 
            complete disruption of day-to-day work during the height of the pandemic. The use of computational 
            systems allowed researchers and scientists to track the spread of the virus and search for solutions 
            to combat the spread of the virus. Using online, collaborative software such as 'Microsoft Teams' for 
            meetings, allowed groups to work together without close contact.
            Computer systems have helped enormously with the control and management of Covid. 3D printers were 
            used for helping to produce PPE equipment like masks and visors. The collection and analysis of data, 
            has helped with decision making, and technology played a crucial role in developing a vaccine for the 
            virus. "Technologies powered by artificial intelligence (AI) including machine learning, image 
            recognition, and deep learning algorithms can be used for early detection 
            and diagnosis of the infection, more rapid drug discovery for developing new treatments 
            (Brohi, Jhanjhi, Brohi, & Brohi, 2020)." The potential of AI to develop scientific solutions, for Covid and 
            a range of other challenging social issues, is an area that I intend to study further.

        <h3>1.2  Response to the brief (approximately 150 ‐ 200 words)</h3>
        <div id="vaccine-div">
            <img src="/resources/Pfizer.png" class="vaccine-logo">
            <img src="/resources/AstraZeneca.png" class="vaccine-logo">

        </div>
        <p>For this project, I have focused on alleviating the problem of too many people gathering in crowds indoors. 
            A high concentration of people in an enclosed area, prevents them from maintaining the required social 
            distance of 2 meters. This increases the risk of the virus spreading. So, by developing an information 
            system that helps to inform people when there are too many people gathering in a particular area, will 
            help to reduce the spread of the virus.
            There are a number of ways of developing this information system, such as the use of drones using 
            software to count the number of people gathering in a group outdoors; but considering the limitations 
            of the technology at my disposal, I've decided to focus on a system to count people entering and 
            exiting buildings. The microbit will act
            as a data collection device, which is activated by a person passing through a doorway. The maximum number 
            of people allowed in the building will be calculated using the area of the indoor space. Based on this 
            number,
            the microbit will signal to people at the entrance of the building, whether they can enter, using a 
            traffic light 
            system. When the number of people in the building is below capacity, there will be a green light at 
            the entrance, along with the word: 'Enter'. When the number of people in the building has reached 
            the capacity, the green light will be replaced with a red light and the message: 'Capacity reached. Wait for 
            green light to enter.'

        <h2>3.  Design and Development of the Artefact</h2>

        <h3>3.1  The Iterative Design Process (approximately 700 ‐ 800 words)</h3>

        <p>
            <img src="/resources/Iterative-design-process.jpg" id="idp">
        </p>

        <p>I've chosen the 'waterfall' design approach. I considered using 'agile', but since I do not have the 
            option of close cooperation of the end user on a regular basis, I felt that the 'waterfall' approach
        was more appropriate. The waterfall approach is in line with the project requirements, which requires formal, 
        detailed documentation, making the deign process easier to understand for members who join the team at a 
        later stage.<br>
        The waterfall approach to software development involves a formal, more rigid approach to the design process.
            It is a staged process, rather than an iterative process but like most software projects, some iteration 
            is common. Each stage of the process should be completed 
            before the next stage begins; and the stages should move in one direction, like a waterfall.<br>
            The features of a waterfall design process include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A staged process</li>
                <li>Reviewing completed stages, before moving on to the next stage</li>
                <li>Finding problems early on, so they are easier and less expensive to fix</li>
                <li>Detailed, formal documentation</li>
            </ul><br>
            

            <h3>ITERATIVE DESIGN PROCESS</h3>
            
           <img id="timeline" src="/resources/timeline.png">
            
            <p><u>Investigate:</u></p>
            <p>I read through the webpages and documents provided in the project brief:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>General information on the coronavirus</li>
                    <li>Issues and measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus</li>
                    <li>The use of technology to help reduce the spread of the virus</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I did further research on the topic using the internet, focusing on technological 
                    solutions to help reduce the spread of Covid. I also became familiar with the 
                    Microbit and it's accessories, to give me a better idea of potential solutions
                    and limitations.
                </p>


            <p><u>Plan:</u></p>
            <p>To help me make a plan for the project, I made a mind-map, including all the 
                relevent information. Using abstraction, I represented subtopics keywords and phrases. This, along with the graphical aspect
            of the mind-map, helped me to see the 'big picture'.</p>
                <img id="mindmap" src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTGD2PO26_ZoPRRshCDNStoYLKy0tq7U2C0ffYo78PqessMluUGs84xm8Qhy_0mQm5PVHpPcWmMSTN5/pub?w=960&amp;h=520">
                <p>Using the mind-map, I made notes on possible technological solutions, and I came up with an 
                    information system for shops, to keep the number of customers in the shop under a maximum
                    capacity, to allow people to maintain social distancing. As part of the plan, I kept 
                    the timescale in mind to ensure the process is completed within the 8 week timeframe. I 
                    also made a list of the necessary resources, such as hardware and software needed for the task. 
                </p>

            <p><u>Design:</u></p> 
            <p>I used graphic design software to help me organise and design the project. It's a top-down design. 
                As you can see from the diagram below, I utilised decomposition, to break down the problem into a set of
                smaller, simpler tasks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Write an algorithm for the program on the Microbit</li>
                    <li>Use a python programme to transmit the data to a cloud database</li>
                    <li>Retrieve the data from the database using Javascript</li>
                    <li>Data analysis is done using python</li>
                    <li>Display the data analysis on the website</li>
                </ul> 
                 
            
            <img id="project-design" src="/resources/project-design.png">

            <p><u>Create:</u></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Built the embedded system using the microbit and accessories, including a battery pack, 
                    breakout board, breadboard, jumper leads, and LEDs.</li>
                <li>Makecode program written and downloaded to Microbit (screenshot of code below).</li>
                <li>Microbit plugged into laptop and data transferred as a csv file.</li>
                <li>Python program used to convert data and sent to firebase database.</li>
                <li>Data retrieved from database and analysed using python.</li>
                <li>Data analysis displayed on website.</li>
            </ol> 
    
            <img src="resources/make-code-supermarket.png" id="make-code-supermarket">

            <p><u>Evaluate:</u></p>
