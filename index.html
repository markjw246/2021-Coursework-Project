        <h2>1.  A Rationale for the Approach to the Brief</h2>
        <h3>1.1  Research (approximately 150 ‐ 200 words)</h3>
        <img  id="vaccine" src="/resources/Covid-19-vaccine.jpg">
        <p>The Covid pandemic has had an enormous impact on hospitals, the economy, businesses and schools. 
            Technology is one of the main supports in finding solutions to slow down and stop the spread of 
            Covid 19. The quick transition of businesses and schools to online, remote working, prevented the 
            complete disruption of day-to-day work during the height of the pandemic. The use of computational 
            systems allowed researchers and scientists to track the spread of the virus and search for solutions 
            to combat the spread of the virus. Using online, collaborative software such as 'Microsoft Teams' for 
            meetings, allowed groups to work together without close contact.
            Computer systems have helped enormously with the control and management of Covid. 3D printers were 
            used for helping to produce PPE equipment like masks and visors. The collection and analysis of data, 
            has helped with decision making, and technology played a crucial role in developing a vaccine for the 
            virus. "Technologies powered by artificial intelligence (AI) including machine learning, image 
            recognition, and deep learning algorithms can be used for early detection 
            and diagnosis of the infection, more rapid drug discovery for developing new treatments 
            (Brohi, Jhanjhi, Brohi, & Brohi, 2020)." The potential of AI to develop scientific solutions, for Covid and 
            a range of other challenging social issues, is an area that I intend to study further.

        <h3>1.2  Response to the brief (approximately 150 ‐ 200 words)</h3>
        <p>For this project, I have focused on alleviating the problem of too many people gathering in crowds indoors. 
            A high concentration of people in an enclosed area, prevents them from maintaining the required social 
            distance of 2 meters. This increases the risk of the virus spreading. So, by developing an information 
            system that helps to inform people when there are too many people gathering in a particular area, will 
            help to reduce the spread of the virus.
            There are a number of ways of developing this information system, such as the use of drones using 
            software to count the number of people gathering in a group outdoors; but considering the limitations 
            of the technology at my disposal, I've decided to focus on a system to count people entering and 
            exiting buildings. The microbit will act
            as a data collection device, which is activated by a person passing through a doorway. The maximum number 
            of people allowed in the building will be calculated using the area of the indoor space. Based on this 
            number,
            the microbit will signal to people at the entrance of the building, whether they can enter, using a 
            traffic light 
            system. When the number of people in the building is below capacity, there will be a green light at 
            the entrance, along with the word: 'Enter'. When the number of people in the building has reached 
            the capacity, the green light will be replaced with a red light and the message: 'Capacity reached. Wait for 
            green light to enter.'
        </p>

        <h3>3.1  The Iterative Design Process (approximately 700 ‐ 800 words)</h3>

        <p>
            <img src="/resources/Iterative-design-process.jpg" id="idp">
        </p>

        <p>I've chosen the 'waterfall' design approach. I considered using 'agile', but since I do not have the 
            option of close cooperation of the end user on a regular basis, I felt that the 'waterfall' approach
        was more appropriate. The waterfall approach is in line with the project requirements, which requires formal, 
        detailed documentation, making the deign process easier to understand for memebrs who join the team at a 
        later stage.<br>
        The waterfall approach to software development involves a formal, more rigid approach to the design process.
            It is a staged process, rather than an iterative process. Each stage of the process should be completed 
            before the next stage begins; and the stages should move in one direction, like a waterfall.<br>
            The features of a waterfall design process include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A staged process</li>
                <li>Reviewing completed stages, before moving on to the next stage</li>
                <li>Finding problems early on, so they are easier and less expensive to fix</li>
                <li>Detailed, formal documentation</li>
            </ul><br>

        Summary: Record your activities, thinking and adaptations as you progress through each iteration 
of each stage of the design cycle and use these recordings to describe the design process leading 
to your solution. 
Key questions:  
 What design approach did you take?  
 What are the stages involved and what activities did you carry out during each stage?  
 Did you iterate? If so, why and how often?  
 What problems occurred during the design and how did you overcome them?  
 Did you change your mind about any aspect of the design or did you decide to add any new 
features to the design at any stage? If so, why, and what was the impact? 
        <h3>3.2  Development of the Artefact (approximately 900 ‐ 1000 words)</h3>
        Summary: Explain the system architecture and detail the design, development, testing and 
deployment/implementation phases of the development. 
Key Questions:  
 What is the overall design (system architecture)?  
 If the system is composed of multiple sub‐systems how do these relate to one another?  
 What are the main features of the system and how are these realised (i.e. explain the design)? 
 How was the system developed?  
 What technologies were used?  
 Were there any social or ethical considerations?  
 How has data been gathered, validated and stored? 
 What use cases were employed for testing?  
 What problems occurred during the implementation and how did you overcome them?  

        <h2>4.  Evaluation of the artefact</h2>
        How well you achieved your design ambitions. 
 The degree to which you met the requirements of the brief – you should examine each of the 
artefact features listed in the brief, and explain how your artefact meets, or does not meet, 
these features. 
 How well the needs of the envisaged end user were met. Include reference to any unexpected 
results encountered in the application of your artefact.
